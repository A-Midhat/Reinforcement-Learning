# Reinforcement Learning from Scratch

Welcome to my **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Playground!** This repository is a personal project where I implement various RL algorithms from scratch, purely for fun and learning. The goal is to build a solid intuition behind RL concepts by implementing them step by step, without relying on high-level libraries.

## 📌 Implemented Algorithms

### **1️⃣ Dynamic Programming & Classical Methods**
- ✅ Value Iteration
- ✅ Policy Iteration
- ✅ Monte Carlo Methods
- ✅ Temporal Difference (TD) Learning

### **2️⃣ Tabular RL**
- ✅ Q-Learning
- ✅ SARSA
- 
### **3️⃣ Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**
- ✅ Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- ✅ REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient)


### **5️⃣ Advanced RL (SOTA)**
- 🔄 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (planned)
- 🔄 Deep Determinstic Policy Gradient (DDPG) (planned)
- 🔄 Twin-Delayed Deep Determinstic Policy Gradient (TD3) (planned)
- 🔄 Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (planned)
